A deep learning project that implements facial emotion recognition using transfer learning with MobileNet architecture. The model can classify human emotions from facial expressions into four categories: Happy, Angry, Fear, and Neutral.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project leverages the power of transfer learning to build an efficient emotion recognition system. By using a pre-trained MobileNet model as the backbone, we achieve good performance while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time applications.

### Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained MobileNet for efficient feature extraction
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Classification**: Lightweight model suitable for mobile and edge deployment
- ‚úÖ **Data Augmentation**: Comprehensive augmentation strategy to improve generalization
- ‚úÖ **Model Persistence**: Save and load trained models for deployment
- ‚úÖ **Visualization**: Training history and confusion matrix analysis
- ‚úÖ **Robust Training**: Early stopping and learning rate scheduling

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
Python 3.7+
pip or conda package manager
```

## üé≠ Supported Emotions

The model classifies facial expressions into four primary emotions:

| Emotion | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Happy** | Joyful, smiling expressions |
| **Angry** | Frustrated, angry expressions |
| **Fear** | Scared, worried expressions |
| **Neutral** | Calm, expressionless faces |
